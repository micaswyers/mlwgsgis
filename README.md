## Why is it useful?
Every year, I am tasked with contacting alumni from my graduating class, asking for donations to the school's foundation. I used to do this manually, but then I remembered that I am a software engineer and can automate away such tasks.

## Can I use it?
Sure, you can, but I wrote this as a one-off script that is specific to the contact information spreadsheed that I get every year from the Foundation. If you choose to adapt it for your own use, you will have to enter in your own credentials (and get yourself a Twilio number) as environment variables.
